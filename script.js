// JavaScript for ARMStatues demo site
//
// Currently this file is intentionally minimal. It serves as a placeholder
// for future interactivity such as product filtering, cart updates, or
// animated navigation transitions. Keeping a dedicated JS file makes it
// easy to expand functionality without cluttering the HTML markup.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    // Example: log a message to confirm the script is loaded
    console.log('ARMStatues scripts loaded');
    // In a full implementation you might add listeners for modals,
    // dynamic cart functionality or search filtering here.
